* Put all .py files in src. main.py is where the main code will be. I don't know atm. if we'll have more than 1 .py file, so add files as needed.
* Put all audio files in audio (not the .py files that use them, but the mp3/audio type file itself)
* Put all graphic/image files in graphics (also not the .py files that use them, but the actual .jpg/png files).
* Put all text related files in text
